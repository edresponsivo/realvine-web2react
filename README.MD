# HTML Responsive Website Adapted to React JS

### Objective: Practice converting to React Components

**Inspiration Source:**
Source: https://github.com/codewithsadee/realvine
Live Site: https://codewithsadee.github.io/realvine/

Notes:
I found the structure of the website was very well documented with comments and good markup.

**First Phase**:

- Import all the References in the html head
- Import Assets
- Build the Skeleton based on the Section Comments found in the HTML
- Create each React Component starting with basic structure
  - Header
  - Main
  - Footer
  - Back To Top Link
- the Main Component has the following:

  - Hero
  - About
  - Service
  - Property
  - Contact
  - Newsletter

  **Second Phase**
  Extracted each individual Property data to the data.js
  Created Individual Property Component.

GitHub Action Workflow established

### TODO

- Create more subcomponents
  - break down the data in js files.
- Use React states for interactivity

### Notes:

Javascript file from source is commented to have it just for reference, at later time apply to Use State from react.
