# HTML Responsive Website Adapted to React JS

### Objective: Practice converting to React Components

**Inspiration Source:**
Source: https://github.com/codewithsadee/realvine
Live Site: https://codewithsadee.github.io/realvine/

Notes: 
I found the structure of the website was very well documented with comments and good markup.

**First Phase**:
- Import all the References in the html head
- Import Assets
- Build the Skeleton based on the Section Comments found in the HTML
- Create each React Component starting with basic structure 
    - Header
    - Main 
    - Footer
    - Back To Top Link
- the Main Component has the following:
    - Hero
    - About
    - Service
    - Property
    - Contact
    - Newsletter

### TODO

- Create more subcomponents
    - break down the data in js files.
- Use React states for interactivity

### Notes:
Javascript file from source is commented.
